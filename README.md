# Launch

Launch is my first attempt at creating my own game engine. I've studied the tech and theory that goes into it, but never actually given it a serious try.

I'm following [TheCherno's Hazel youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) for now and as such this engine very closely resembles an early version of [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), but once the core engine is up and running I will be branching off to customize this myself
